*IPOP (IP-Over-P2P)* is an open-source user-centric software virtual network allowing end users to define and create their own virtual private networks (VPNs). IPOP virtual networks provide end-to-end tunneling of IP or Ethernet over [Tincan] links setup and managed through a control API to create various software-defined VPN overlays.

## <i class="fa fa-cubes" aria-hidden="true"></i> Unique Features

- In contrast to typical VPN technologies, which require complex setup, management and a gateway to relay VPN traffic, IPOP is straightforward to configure, because:
- It runs on existing Internet infrastructure, without requiring any specialized networking infrastructure (e.g. hardware switches/routers, or virtual routers);
- It uses online social network (OSN) infrastructures to allow users to define their own networks;
- It seamlessly traverses firewalls, NATs, and create VPN tunnels in a peer-to-peer fashion, avoiding the need for centralized VPN gateways.
