*IPOP (IP-Over-P2P)* is an open-source user-centric software virtual network allowing end users to define and create their own virtual private networks (VPNs). IPOP virtual networks provide end-to-end tunneling of IP or Ethernet over *TinCan* links setup and managed through a control API to create various software-defined VPN overlays.
