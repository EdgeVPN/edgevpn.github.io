## Introduction

EdgeVPN.io relies on XMPP services to bootstrap nodes into the VPN. This how-to guides you through the process of deploying an Openfire XMPP server using Docker. 

**Note 1**: this how-to deploys Openfire with an embedded database in a Docker container and is meant to be used as a starting point for testing. This how-to is **not** intended to guide you through a process to configure/host a persistent MySQL and XMPP server - there are additional steps you'd need to do that are specific to your domain. There are also several options to host persistent Openfire services on cloud providers, such as https://bitnami.com/stack/openfire

**Note 2**: This how-to has been tested with Openfire version 4.5.1

### Step 1: Install Docker

Make sure you have Docker installed in your system. 

You may [follow a guide on how to install Docker for your system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), or you may follow the instructions below to install Docker (and other dependences) if you are using Ubuntu 18.04:

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu bionic stable"
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install -y openvswitch-switch \
                        python3 python3-pip python3-venv \
                        apt-transport-https \
                        ca-certificates \
                        curl git \
                        software-properties-common \
                        containerd.io \
                        docker-ce-cli \
                        docker-ce 
groupadd -f docker
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER
```

### Step 2: Run Openfire Docker container

We will use the Docker container from quantumobject:

```
docker run --name openfire -d -p 9090:9090 -p 5222:5222 -p 5269:5269 -p 5223:5223 -p 7443:7443 -p 7777:7777 -p 7070:7070 -p 5229:5229 -p 5275:5275 quantumobject/docker-openfire
```

### Step 3: Configure Openfire

1. Point your browser to http://A.B.C.D:9090, where A.B.C.D is the IP address of the Docker host

2. Select your language, and continue

3. Set both XMPP domain and server host name as _local_

4. Select “Embedded database” and continue:

![Set used database for XMPP](/assets/images/openfire_set_db.png)

5. Select “default” for profile settings and continue

6. Enter your email address, and a password for the _admin_ user

7. A prompt to "Login to the admin console" appears; when you click on it, log in with user _admin_ and the password you just created

### Step 4: Let’s add test users and group them

You will now use the Web admin interface to create two test users - *test1* and *test2* - and assign them to a group (i.e. they will join the same network) 

Start by creating the two users:

1. Navigate the user interface to Users/Groups -> Users -> Create New User
2. Select username and password - we’ll use (test1, password_test1) and (test2, password_test2) for the (user, password) pairs in the examples below. Once a user is created, you'll see that it's been added:

![User added to XMPP database](/assets/images/openfire_added_user.png)

3. Repeat, creating the user test2 

Then, create a group:

1. Navigate the user interface to Users/Groups -> Groups -> Create New Group, and create _grouptest1_
2. Select “Enable contact list group sharing”, select share group with “Users of the same group”, and click on "Save contact list sharing":

![Enable contact list sharing](/assets/images/openfire_share_contact.png)

3. Scroll down the interface to add users test1 and test2 to this group

### Step 5: Configure

You are now ready to configure the system to use this XMPP server. [Follow the instructions on how to install EdgeVPN.io using Docker](/dockeredgevpn) to setup two containers for users test1 and test2
