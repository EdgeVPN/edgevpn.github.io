*SocialVPN* is an open-source IPOP-based virtual network that connects your computers privately to your friends’ computers. It automatically maps online social network relationships using Jingle and  XMPP  to create your own user-defined peer-to-peer VPNs – with no hassle, and supporting unmodified TCP/IP applications. In the SocialVPN, each user is in control of who their VPN connects to. To scale to large online social networks, SocialVPN employs a unique dynamic IPv4 address allocation/translation approach that avoids conflicts with local networks and devices outside a user’s social network. These are some of the ways you can use SocialVPN:

## Private data sharing

SocialVPN allows you to create private, end-to-end virtual IP networks connecting you to your friends. You can use these links to privately share data with your friends, using existing applications for file transfer and sharing.

##Mobile cloud computing

SocialVPN runs on Android devices and allows users to create VPNs connecting mobile devices as well as desktops, laptops and servers. It provides a basis for research and development on “social area networks” for data sharing and computational offloading.

## Decentralized OSNs

SocialVPN creates a communication overlay that can be used as a basis to design decentralized Online Social Networks (OSNs).
