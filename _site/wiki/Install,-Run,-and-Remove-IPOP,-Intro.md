# Install, Run, and Remove IPOP, Intro

## Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

We currently support the following operating systems and platforms:
- Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 - x64
- Raspbian Jessie and Stretch on Raspberry Pi 3 - ARM7
- CentOS 7 - x64
- Microsoft Windows 10 - x64

## Other Operating Systems and Platforms

If the requirements are met, for other versions and flavors of Ubuntu or other Debian-based Linux distros, our Ubuntu release should work out-of-the-box. Other versions of Raspberry Pi such as Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi Zero and also other Debian-based operating systems on ARM architecture, such as Orange Pi, will most probably work with our Raspberry Pi 3 release. If it didn't work, you may need to build IPOP code manually on that machine. There is a chance you also need to build WebRTC static libraries before that.
