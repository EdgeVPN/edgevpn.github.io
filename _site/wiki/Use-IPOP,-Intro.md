# Use IPOP, Intro

## Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

We currently support the following operating systems and platforms:
- [Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 - x64](Use-IPOP-on-Ubuntu-and-Raspberry-Pi,-Manually)
- [Raspbian Jessie and Stretch on Raspberry Pi 3 - ARM7](Use-IPOP-on-Ubuntu-and-Raspberry-Pi,-Manually)
- [Microsoft Windows 10 - x64](Use-IPOP-on-Windows,-Manually)
- [CentOS 7 - x64](https://github.com/ipop-project/ipop-project.github.io/wiki/Use-IPOP-on-CentOS,-Manually)

## Other Operating Systems and Platforms

If the requirements are met, for other versions and flavors of Ubuntu or other Debian-based Linux distros, our Ubuntu release should work out-of-the-box. Other versions of Raspberry Pi such as Raspberry Pi 2 and Raspberry Pi Zero and also other Debian-based operating systems on ARM architecture, such as Orange Pi, will most probably work with our Raspberry Pi 3 release. If it didn't work, you may need to build IPOP code manually on that machine. There is a chance you also need to build WebRTC static libraries before that.
