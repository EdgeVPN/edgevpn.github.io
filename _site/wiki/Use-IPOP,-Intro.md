# Use IPOP, Intro

## Supported Operating Systems and Platforms

We currently support the following operating systems and platforms:
- [Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04, 64-bit](Use-IPOP-on-Ubuntu-and-Raspberry-Pi,-Manually)
- [Raspbian Stretch on Raspberry Pi 3, ARMv7](Use-IPOP-on-Ubuntu-and-Raspberry-Pi,-Manually)
- [Raspbian Stretch on Raspberry Pi Zero, ARMv6](Use-IPOP-on-Ubuntu-and-Raspberry-Pi,-Manually)
- [Microsoft Windows 10, 64-bit](Use-IPOP-on-Windows,-Manually)
- [CentOS 7, 64-bit](Use-IPOP-on-CentOS,-Manually)

## Other Operating Systems and Platforms

If the requirements are met, for other versions and flavors of Ubuntu or other Debian-based Linux distros, our Ubuntu release should work out-of-the-box. Raspberry Pi 2 and other Debian-based ARMv7 devices should work with Raspberry Pi 3 release, and Raspberry Pi 1 and other Debian-based ARMv6 devices should work with Raspberry Pi Zero release. If not, you may need to build IPOP code manually on that machine. There is a chance you also need to build WebRTC static libraries before that.
