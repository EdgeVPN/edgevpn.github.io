# Wiki Maintenance Tips

- Follow the page format from [Use IPOP on Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi, Manually](Use-IPOP-on-Ubuntu-and-Raspberry-Pi,-Manually).
- Every wiki page should start with a Header 1 title. It would be the title of the respective page on the website. Otherwise, the page won't have a title on the website.
- There should be a blank line before each table. Otherwise, the table won't render correctly on the website. That won't affect the table view on the wiki, though.
- Avoid using anything that looks like Liquid objects and tags on the wiki. Those will cause an error while building the website. If you need more info, take a look at the [Liquid Introduction](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction/).
- The website will be updated according to the wiki updates once in a while, probably every few weeks. If you have applied an update to the wiki and you think it is necessary to be reflected on the website soon, contact *vdaneshmand {at} acis.ufl.edu*.
