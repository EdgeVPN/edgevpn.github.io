# Build WebRTC Libraries, Intro

At its core, IPOP leverages existing technologies (Jingle/WebRTC) and standards (STUN, TURN, XMPP) to tunnel IP packets over P2P links between computers â€“ even when they are behind firewalls and/or Network Address Translators (NATs).

There is [a documentation on WebRTC official website on how to build WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/native-code/development/) which is the main approach we have in building WebRTC libraries for building IPOP.
