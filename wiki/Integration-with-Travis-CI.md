Travis CI is a hosted continuous integration platform that is free for all open source projects hosted on Github. With just a file called `.travis.yml` containing some information about our project, we can trigger automated builds with every change to our code.

These instructions are based on following links:
* [https://travis-ci.com/getting_started](https://travis-ci.com/getting_started)
* [https://docs.travis-ci.com/](https://docs.travis-ci.com/)

## Activate GitHub Repositories
1.  Sign in to Travis CI with your GitHub account, accepting the GitHub access permissions confirmation.

2.  Once youâ€™re signed in, and Travis CI has synchronized your repositories from GitHub, go to your [profile](https://travis-ci.com/profile) page and enable Travis CI for the repository you want to build.

3.  Flip the switch to on for all repositories you'd like to enable.


## Write configuration file to your repository
In order for Travis CI to build your project, you'll need to write a file named `.travis.yml`.

1.  Add a `.travis.yml` file to the root of your repository.

2.  Following the link below to write configuration information into `.travis.yml` file.

  [https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/)

3.  Here is a sample `.travis.yml` configuration file for ipop-tincan repository:
  ```bash
  language: cpp
  compiler:
  - g++
  os:
  - linux
  before_install:
  - sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test -y
  - sudo apt-get update -qq
  install:
  - sudo apt-get install g++-4.8 -y
  - sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 50
  script: make
  ```
  **Tip:** _Because the g++ version(4.6) on Travis CI is lack of support for c++11, so we need to install a newer version g++(4.8+) to build the code._


## Trigger your first build with a git push

1.  To start a build, perform one of the following:
  * Commit and push something to your repository
  * Go to your repository's settings page, click on "Webhooks & Services" on the left menu, choose "Travis CI" in the "Services", and use the "Test service" button.

  **Note:** _You cannot trigger your first build using Test Hook button. It has to be triggered by a push to your repository._


2.  Check the [build status](https://travis-ci.org/repositories) page to see if your build passes or fails.
